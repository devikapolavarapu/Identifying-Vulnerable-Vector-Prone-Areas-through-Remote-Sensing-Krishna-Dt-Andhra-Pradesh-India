# Identifying Vulnerable Vector-Prone Areas through Remote Sensing  
## Krishna District, Andhra Pradesh, India

## Abstract
Vector-borne diseases such as dengue and chikungunya pose significant public health challenges in tropical regions. This research presents a **Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS)–based spatial framework** to identify **vulnerable mosquito vector-prone areas** in **Krishna District, Andhra Pradesh, India**. Multi-temporal **Landsat-8 satellite imagery** was integrated with environmental, climatic, population, and health-related datasets to generate a **district-level risk zonation map**. The framework supports early risk identification and enables data-driven public health planning by minimizing dependence on manual field surveys.

## 1. Introduction
The spatial distribution of mosquito vectors is strongly influenced by environmental factors such as surface water availability, moisture persistence, vegetation density, and temperature. Traditional surveillance techniques are often reactive, time-consuming, and spatially limited.

Advancements in satellite remote sensing and GIS provide an effective platform for large-scale, predictive disease risk assessment. This study aims to identify environmentally vulnerable regions conducive to mosquito breeding in Krishna District using geospatial analysis techniques.

## 2. Study Area
**Krishna District**, located in the coastal region of **Andhra Pradesh, India**, is characterized by:
- Tropical climatic conditions  
- Dense population settlements  
- Extensive irrigation and water-logged agricultural areas  

These factors collectively increase susceptibility to mosquito vector proliferation.

## 3. Objectives
- To derive environmental indicators influencing mosquito breeding using satellite data  
- To integrate RS and GIS techniques for spatial risk modeling  
- To generate a **district-level vector vulnerability map**  
- To classify regions into **high, medium, and low risk zones**

## 5. Methodology

### 5.1 Satellite Data Processing
Landsat-8 imagery was pre-processed and analyzed using **ArcGIS** to extract relevant environmental parameters.

### 5.2 Derivation of Environmental Indices
The following indices were computed:
- **NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index):** Detection of surface water and water-logged areas  
- **NDMI (Normalized Difference Moisture Index):** Identification of moisture persistence  
- **NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index):** Assessment of vegetation density  
- **Land Surface Temperature (LST):** Evaluation of temperature suitability for mosquito survival  

### 5.3 Spatial Risk Modeling
- All thematic layers were normalized  
- Weights were assigned based on vector-breeding relevance  
- A **weighted overlay analysis** was performed to compute a composite risk index  

### 5.4 Risk Zonation
The final risk map categorizes Krishna District into:
- High vulnerability zones  
- Medium vulnerability zones  
- Low vulnerability zones

## 6. Results and Discussion
The resulting risk zonation map highlights regions with persistent surface water, dense vegetation, high moisture content, and optimal temperature ranges as high-risk zones. The spatial patterns observed align with known environmental conditions favorable for mosquito breeding, validating the effectiveness of the RS–GIS approach.
